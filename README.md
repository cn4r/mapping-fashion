FAQ

<strong>How do I interpret the map?  </strong>
<br>
Given any designer A, the closer in position a designer B is to them on the map, the more likely they are to be similar in terms of the kinds of audience they attract. If there’s a line connecting A and B, Grailed says they’re related. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Where is the data from?  </strong>
<br>
This map was informed solely by Grailed (grailed.com) data. Any designer on Grailed that’s sold at any of the 4 Dover Street Market e-shops and related designers should be present. I plan on making the map with all ~8000 available soon, but it takes a really long time to load.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>Why is it accurate? </strong>
<br>
A good answer to this question requires being transparent about my data collection process, and for legal reasons I can’t do that right now but hope to soon.  
<br>
<br>
Again— the idea governing this tool’s efficacy is that proximity in space can be viewed as representative of the amount of similarity between designers (in terms of their audience & prospective markets). So a lot of accuracy here would mean that spatial arrangements would closely reflect similarity. For the visualization itself to be accurate, 1) the similarity index I’ve chosen itself would have to be accurate and 2) the way I visually represent similarity would have to do justice to said index.  
<br>
<br>
The similarity index I use is based on data from Grailed, which is based on Grailed’s algorithm, which is a black box. The way in which I visually represent the data is by employing a force-directed algorithm that takes into account the nature of each node’s connections with other nodes (as per the data I have) and positions them on the network accordingly.  
<br>
<br>
I don’t know how faithful this algorithm is to Grailed’s algorithm. But I also don’t know how I’d evaluate the accuracy of Grailed’s algorithm (through the data I have) in the first place. And this is the only publicly available tool of its kind that I know of, so without analogous methods to compare this to, it’s hard to say how good it is at what it does.

<strong>How do I use it? </strong>
<br>
See Guide.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How often is it updated?</strong>
<br>
The first day of every month. Little changes over this timeframe, however.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>I want to know more.</strong>
<br>
There’s a lot I’m not making public due to the sensitive nature of the data and this project. But please email me at cnarayanan@wesleyan.edu with inquiries.
